# 🌾 Smart Agro Advisor

Smart Agro Advisor is an AI-powered system that helps farmers detect crop diseases from images and receive personalized advice based on weather data and expert rules.  
It integrates machine learning, weather APIs, and WhatsApp automation (via Twilio) to deliver instant and accessible agricultural insights.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 **Crop Disease Detection** using deep learning models.  
- ☁️ **Weather Integration** via OpenWeather API.  
- 💬 **WhatsApp Chatbot Support** powered by Twilio API.  
- 🧠 **AI-Generated Recommendations** for crop management.  
- 🌍 **User-Friendly Web Interface** for uploading and analyzing crop images.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smart_agro_advisor.git
cd smart_agro_advisor
````

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate      # (Mac/Linux)
env\Scripts\activate         # (Windows)
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER= your twilio sandbox whatsapp number
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

### 5️⃣ Run the App

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser. or whatever port your project is running on

## 📡 WhatsApp Integration (Twilio)

1. Join the [Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp](https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp).
2. Update your Twilio credentials in the `.env` file.
3. Set your webhook URL (e.g., from `ngrok`) in the Twilio Console:

   ```
   https://<your-ngrok-url>.ngrok-free.app/whatsapp
   ```

## 🤖 Model & AI Components

* **Disease Detection:** CNN-based image classifier trained on crop disease datasets.
* **Weather Advisory:** Fetches real-time temperature & humidity data.
* **AI Advisor:** Uses GPT-based text generation to provide adaptive farming tips.

---

## 🧪 Example Workflow

1. A user sends a crop image via WhatsApp.
2. The backend processes the image and predicts the disease.
3. Weather data for the user’s location is fetched.
4. AI generates a farming recommendation.
5. The user receives the results directly in WhatsApp.
But before all these to ensure the modell works well there are some things you have to make sure are up and running nicely
- firstly you obviously have to run your backend server whcih is the app.py file
- secondly you need to make sure your ngrok server is running to caise without it you cannot communicate with your twilio sandbox and that means you cant talk to your Whatsapp route
- thirdly your twilio sandbox has to be connected to your WhatsApp number which you will be using to talk to your model
